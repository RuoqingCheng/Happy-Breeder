Project Specification Feedback
==================

Commit graded: 

### The product backlog (10/10)

Product backlog is generally complete and adequate.
One suggestion is to start playing around with the Javascript library the team has chosen to work with. I like how the team organise your information in a table, with due dates and the priority of each task! Also, since it is a four person team, do make sure that your app is complex enough - it would be useful to start thinking about features that the team would like to implement to increase the complexity!

### Data models (10/10)

Models are generally complete and adequate.
I am slightly confused about what would be the content in the Message model. Also, one suggestion is to use the db shell to see whether all the actions can be performed. An example would be in order to get all the logs for a Breeder, how would you use your model to get all the relevanty information? Just a suggestion to make sure the model is constructed correctly initially.

### Wireframes or mock-ups (9/10)

Wireframes are generally complete and adequate, some wireframes are missing - such as what would be the screen when users are viewing all other user's home? Also, what would be the process of adopting a pet? One suggestion is to think about the different functionalities that a user can perform and have some wireframes for each action. This would make the coding process much easier.
